        <h1 id="title">Topics about Computer Engineering</h1>
        <p><b>Computer Engineering</b> uses of principle from computer science and electrical Engineering to create hardware (physical components) and firmware which are used in a wide range of areas:- consumer electronics, medicial devices, communication systems, aircraft, self driving cars, etc</p>
        <p><b>Computer Engineering</b> students learn how to develop, prototype, and test micro-chips, circuits, processors, conductors and any other component used in computers devices  or system (e.g supercomputers, smartphones, laptops, servers, IoT gadgets). They also develop firmware, an essential type of software that allows operating systems and applications to take full advantage of the hardware.</p>
    <h2 id="sub"><u>Computer Engineering specialisation</u></h2>
        <P><b>In addition to general computer Engineering degrees, universities and colleges also offer different specialisations or subdisciplines<br/> if you want to narrow down your focus.</b></P>
        <p><b>Here are a few examples:</b></p>
        <ul id="just">
            <li>Hardware systems</li>
            <li>Distributed computing</li>
            <li>Robotics and cybernetics</li>
            <li>Embedded systems</li>
            <li>Computer Graphics and Visualisation</li>
            <li>Medical Image Computing</li>
            <li>Computer and network security</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 id="subtitle"><u>Computer Engineering Classes</u></h2> 
    <P>To know what you'll actually study, checkout the curriculum before choosing an academic programme and don't rely only on the title of the programme.<br/> If you have other questions, contact the University or College where you want to apply. They'll be more than happy to help you.</P>
    <P><b>With that in mind, let's take a look at some typical classes offered by general computer Engineering degrees.</b></P>
    <ul id="line">
        <li><b>Introduction to Electronics</b></li>
        <li><b>Circuit Analysis</b></li>
        <li><b>Signal Processing</b></li>
        <li><b>Engineering Computing</b></li>
        <li><b>Embedded System</b></li>
        <li><b>Computer Networks</b></li>
        <li><b>Computer vision</b></li>
        <li><b>Autonomous Robotics</b></li>
        <li><b>Programming Principles</b></li>
        <li><b>Computer Architecture</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Good to know:- If you plan to study abroad in the United States, some Computer Science schools offer the opportunity to study a double major in both Computer Science and Engineering.<br/>It's a great way to make the best of both worlds, but it's also more challenging than a regular degree.</b></p>

    <p><b>Computer engineering</b> (<b>CoE</b> or <b>CpE</b>) is a branch of <a href="electrical engineering" target="blank">electrical engineering</a> and<br/> computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic<br/> engineering required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer<br/> engineers not only require training in electronic engineering, software design, and<br/> hardware-software integration, but also in software engineering. It uses the<br/> techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, but also<br/> covers areas such as articial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks,<br/> computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in<br/> many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual<br/> microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to<br/> circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems<br/> themselves work, yet it also demands them to integrate into the larger picture.<br/> Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.</p>
